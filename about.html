            <div class="Beginningstext"><p>Starting as two separate brands in two very different fields, Modelo and Scotts Lawn Service decided to merge into one during the Covid-19 pandemic. Modelo took a massive hit during the beginning of the virus due to the fact Modelo and Corona are both owned by Grupo Modelo . People stopped purchasing Corona during the pandemic due to the fear it would give them the coronavirus. As a result of this, Grupo Modelo’s income decreased substantially, they decided they had to discontinue one of the brands. As a result of the free publicity, they chose to discontinue Modelo.  </p></div>
            
            

           <div class="beginningsbottom"> <p>Though Grupo Modelo’s income took a hit, Scotts Lawn Service had the opposite. With everyone at home during the pandemic, they were looking at their lawns more than ever, and everyone ordered Scotts Lawn Food to give them a pandemic task. When Grupo Modelo announced the discontinuation of Modelo beer, one man in particular was furious. This man was James Gimeson, President of Scotts Lawn Service. Gimeson is a huge Modelo fan, it was the only beverage he consumed. With all the extra income Scotts Lawn Service had acquired, Gimeson knew what he had to do. He had to purchase Modelo. Gimeson decided to put an offer for the Modelo brand. Grupo Modelo declined immediately because they didn't want the “Modelo” name used by a different company. So, they made an agreement. Grupo Modelo sold the recipe and brand Identity to James Gimeson, but he could not use the Modelo name. Gimeson and the marketing managers at Scotts Lawn Service decided to name it the same name as their best selling product, “Scotts Fall Lawn Food”. Hoping for amazing sales for their newly acquired beer company.
